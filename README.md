## Description

This repository contains the code for the `Agent Julia` program. This is a model
for measuring the dynamics mtDNA within a 3-dimensional space over the course of
a human life-span of approximately 90 years. It is written in the Julia
programming language and makes use of the `Agents.jl` package.

The timeline of this project is: `26/04/2021` to `20/08/2021` and package
versions will be contemporary to this time and no changes will be applied once
the code is ready for submission. Updates past this time represent a
continuation of the project outside of an academic context.
