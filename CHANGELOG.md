# Changelog

## Version 0.0.1

- Updated `gillespie_model.jl` to contain and plot results of a basic stochastic
  simulation of mtDNA population dynamics.
  - Included use-case scripts which contain elements simulating different
    situations. For example, the `patient_with_inheritance.jl` file contains
    parameters intended to mimic a patient who has inherited mutant mtDNA since
    birth.
  - Included example plots to view what results may look like per-situation.
  - Plots are now stored within a well-defined directory structure.
